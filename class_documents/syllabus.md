# Intro to Computer Vision

## Course Description
Computer Vision is the scientific field that deals with programming computers to "see" the world. From its inception as a research discipline in the early 1960s, the goal of computer vision was to prop up the development of artificial intelligence, the idea being that in order for a computer to act on the world, it must first understand it. As a species that privileges vision above all our other senses, it seemed most logical that making a computer "see" was the best path towards teaching a computer to "know."

In this course, we explore the field of computer vision as both a set of artistic tools, and as a subject of critical inquiry. 

with the goal of allowing a computer to understand the world around it. Of the five basic human senses, vision is the most privileged sense, so it is no coincidence that early research into artificial intelligence saw the ability to allow a robot to "see" and therefore "understand" its environment was understood to be a key prerequisite for creating a robot with artificial intelligence.

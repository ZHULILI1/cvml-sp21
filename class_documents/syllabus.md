## Course Description
Computer Vision is the scientific field that deals with programming computers to "see" the world. From its inception as a research discipline in the early 1960s, the goal of computer vision was to prop up the development of artificial intelligence, the idea being that in order for a computer to act on the world, it must first understand it. As a species that privileges vision above all our other senses, it seemed most logical that making a computer "see" was the best path towards teaching a computer to "know."

In this course, we engage the field of computer vision as both a fertile territory for artistic experimentation, and as a complex subject for critical interrogation. Through technical demonstrations and project-based experimentation, this course will introduce a variety of tools for creating interactive art and machine learning-based generative imagery. Throughout the semester, we will confront the ethical implications of computer vision technologies both as artists creating with these tools, and as citizens in a world where these technologies are ubiquitous, powerful, and often harmful.

This course will teach both "traditional" and machine learning-based approaches to computer vision. At first, we will focus more on writing code to manipulate images, video and live webcam feed. Then, the class will shift its focus away from code and towards working with data, though code will (likely) always enter the equation in some way.

By the end of this course, you should have the capability to continue exploring computer vision tools independently, as well as the critical understading to work with these tools responsibly, and effectively.

## End of Semester Online Exhibition
At the end of the semester, we will present all the work from class in an online gallery format. Since much of the work we'll be doing is web-based, having an online exhibition won't require much extra work beyond what it takes to create a presentable work on the web. On the final day of class, the website gallery should be ready to launch with your "final" versions of your work.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule an appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you with a letter outlining the approved accommodations for you to deliver to your instructors. This letter must be presented before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC is located within the Wellness Center on the 13th floor of 116 S Michigan Ave. and can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at [dlrc@saic.edu](mailto:dlrc@saic.edu).

## Academic Misconduct
From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of recommendation. Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite locations and online education. Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning. It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP authentication, to verify student identity.” Additional resources for students:
* Read “Plagiarism: How to Recognize It and Avoid It: a short guide prepared by the Faculty Senate Student Life Subcommittee in 2004.
* Read the Flaxman Library’s quick guide titled “When to give credit.”

## Attendance
SAIC policy states that students are expected to attend all classes regularly and on time. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. It is the instructor’s responsibility to give this information to the student as his/her/their schedule permits. Missing class for other than a reasonable cause may jeopardize the student’s academic standing in the class. Attendance is required on the final critique day to receive credit for this course.

1. If a student misses MORE than 3 sections, whether or not for a reasonable cause, the student will fail the class, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade of "W."
2. Two late arrivals will count as a missed section. Arriving more than 30 minutes late to class will count as an absence

**Deadline for withdrawal:** Wednesday, March 31, 2021

Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
* Illness or hospitalization (the student should also contact Health Services or their academic advisor, who will relay information to the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
* Family illness or death (the student should also contact their academic advisor, who can relay information to all faculty)
* Observation of a religious holiday (students are expected to notify their instructors in advance to discuss reasonable accommodations for holidays they might observe).

## Writing Center Information
The Writing Center will be open for tutoring appointments entirely online this fall. Tutors are available to assist currently enrolled students with any stage of the writing process, including work for Spine assignments.

# ATS-Specific Information
## ATS Facilities
Normal ATS facilities access, procedures and policies have changed significantly in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Please familiarize yourself with ATS facilities availability, capacity, authorizations, reservations, sanitation and other ATS-specific information in the ATS Facilities Canvas Course.

## ATS Community
ATS is working to build a strong online and offline community during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly encourage all ATS students to sign up for our departmental forum at https://ats.community. Students can find out about visiting artist opportunities, upcoming ATS Town Halls, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion reading group, special events, participate in discussions, and get help with their projects.

## Community in the time of Covid

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. We also recognize that in these unprecedented times each of our relationships to art and education are being asked to change in profound and fundamental ways. This course will not ignore the complexities of how the pandemic, current events, and society's evolving practices in health and safety are influencing our daily abilities to learn and engage.

To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit and recognize the many valid and varying experiences that shape the way we inhabit and express ourselves within this classroom. This means that we will use correct pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of each individual's needs. Each student is expected to practice agency in defining their own learning objectives with this course material and contribute to building a supportive environment for others to define and achieve their own learning objectives. Students are also expected to practice self-care- understanding that each of our learning happens differently as the circumstances of our lives fluctuate. Be patient with yourself and be mindful of what your health and body need in an online learning environment to best achieve your goals. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, in lieu of defensiveness; this class will work to instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

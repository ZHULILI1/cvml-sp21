# Coding Workshop - 02/06/21

## 0. Introduction: Computer Basics

In this section, you will find what basically amounts to me rambling about computers. I have a lot of thoughts about what it means to be an artist working technology. What kind of effort that takes. This rambling is a section of small section of those thoughts. This stuff goes not just for this class, but for any art you do that requires you to deal with technology.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The purpose of this section is not to teach you keyboard shortcuts. You all can figure those out on your own. What I do want to emphasize is how useful learning keyboard shortcuts is. Honestly, I don't know too many, and I forget them pretty quickly. But if I'm doing a repetitive task, I take a few minutes to learn the keyboard shortcuts.

Using your mouse to select thing requires precision--highlighting text, putting your cursor in the exact right place, drawing boxes around things--this is fatiguing.

Your keyboard requires you to know where your keys are, and to remember what key combinations will do what you need them to do. This is also fatiguing. But it can be less so.

Moving your hand between your mouse and your keyboard is both a time sink and a paradigm shift. While you're using your keyboard, you're navigating your content *based on the content*. Your cursor can only move around what's there, and to the spaces where *content* can go.

With your mouse, you're free to move your cursor wherever you want. While this can be freeing, since we can just click the thing we want instead of needing to remember the keyboard shortcut that gets us there, it also breaks us out of the flow of our typing.

Whether its swapping between your mouse and keyboard, or switching between tasks, context-switching is fatiguing. In a way, using a mouse and keyboard *is* multitasking.

There's a momentary discomfort I feel when I try to remember the keyboard shortcut I need to use to, say, duplicate a line of code 10 times. But once I remember it, it's smooth sailing. If I decide to stop typing, and use my mouse to highlight the line of code I need to duplicate, I've broken my flow.

**Okay, let's take a step back**

We can drive ourselves crazy if we spend every moment thinking about how to optimize everything we do. That's what the capitalists want. But in my experience, I've found that knowing just a few shortcuts here and there can save significant amounts of time and energy. This isn't really something anybody teaches you.

I believe there is a false assumption about the technical literacy of the "youth" of today (lol okay). That includes me btw, I promise I'm not talking down to y'all when I say the "youth". I'm more just talking about people who grew up with the Internet. There's an assumption that since we grow up with technology, we are inherently tech-savvy. To a degree, we are. But in my experience, many of the students I work with are unfamiliar with some of the basic functionality of their computers. This isn't a call-out! And it's definitely not a comment on anyone's intelligence! Tech companies, especially companies like apple, have created devices that are too easy to use. The minimalist app-based interfaces obfuscate the inner workings of these technologies, in a way that keeps us from working with the technology directly. Apple can streamline their tools all they want--this doesn't make them any less complicated.

I think the point I would like to make is: *learn how your computer works.* This understanding comes with time. The more you work with your computer, the better you'll understand how it works. But you also need to *actively* work to understand how it works. And that's not always fun. But we all use technology all the time, and if you're an artist looking to work with technology (like we all are here), I'm afraid you must confront the pain of understanding your tools.

Learning code is challenging. It is extra challenging when we only have a loose understanding of the computers on which we're learning to code. The material in this course will be challenging. Not because of the code we'll be dealing with, but because of the way computers bring their own complexity.

[![youtube](images/yt-sm.png) Watch Lecture 1-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv_p-k5fays)

#### 1. Join Slack
  1. [Invite Link (only do this if you haven't already joined the workspace)](https://join.slack.com/t/cvmlsaic-sp21/shared_invite/zt-kzu1o4vp-Zry5GBpQWjBa9IBKDjZ04Q)
  2. [Link to the CVML Slack Workspace](http://cvmlsaic-sp21.slack.com/)
  3. (Recommended) Download the Desktop Slack App. You can use Slack in your browser if you'd prefer.
   
#### 2. Introductions
  1. Fill out [Day 1 Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddOpEisL2auL8DuDzz_cYTnOvEwEUA5jdNgMLJ8OYXCYcOEg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  2. In Zoom, set your Display name to include your preferred name, and your pronouns
  3. Make sure you receive Canvas announcement notifications to your email
  4. Meet everybody!
  5. Go over Syllabus

#### 3. Computer Vision: a brief introduction
1. "Traditional" vs. Machine Learning-based Computer Vision
   1. "Traditional": writing specific algorithms "by hand" that allow a computer to parse images (like brightness thresholding, detecting edges, finding contours). Takes enormous amount of work to write effective algorithms. (For example, programming a computer to identify a dog by **describing in code** what makes a dog a dog)

   *Canny Edge Detection ([Wikipedia, Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection))*
   1. Machine Learning: feeding vast amounts of data into an artificial neural network that then "learns" its own way of describing an image. Often talked about as a form of Artificial Intelligence. (For example, teaching a computer to identify a dog by **feeding it 10,000 images of dogs**, then allowing it to come up with its own description of what a dog is)

   *Convolutional Neural Network with displaying salient features of this image ([ml4a, Convnet Viewer](https://ml4a.github.io/guides/ConvnetViewer/))*
   1. Both techniques are still widely used, as they're both useful for different tasks. They're frequently used together, where traditional CV approaches are used to prepare images for a data set that is then fed to a neural network.

#### 4. Art Examples
